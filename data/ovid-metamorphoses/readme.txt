Ovid, Metamorphoses Lemmatization Project (2018-2019)

This repository contains the latest lemmatization data for Ovidâ€™s Metamorphoses (Ovid-Met-Lemmatized-All.xlsx) as well as the .txt files used in the project.

The .txt files were run through the Bridge Tools scripts to create the lemmatization spreadsheets and to automatically lemmatize unambiguous words. Each book was then completed by an individual Latinist, who validated the automatically generated data and lemmatized the ambiguous forms.

The project began on Dec 21, 2018 (https://twitter.com/bretmulligan/status/1076126015150264320). When completed it will offer the first human-created, digitized, open-access lemmatization of the Metamorphoses.
